  <h1>Hello</h1>
  <p>Mon 8 Aug ☀︎</p>
  <p>I'm using this space for sporadic explorations of HTML, CSS, and digital accessibility. It will probably work like a chair where you put all your clothes when you’re unsure about their short-term reusability.</p>
  <img src=“content/clothes_chair.webp” alt=“Illustration of a wooden chair with a hoodie and a pair of trousers hanging from its back. It casts a long shadow in the warm afternoon light.”>
  <p>The previous image uses the <a href=“https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/”>WebP format</a>: it’s much smaller (around 27 KB) than PNG or JPEG images. This should help improve the performance of the website and, for now, it lets me skip having multiple images for different viewports and resolutions.</p>
