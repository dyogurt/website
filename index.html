  <h1>Hello</h1>
  <p>Mon 8 Aug ☀︎</p>
  <p>I am using this space for sporadically exploring HTML, CSS, and digital accessibility. It will probably work like a chair where you put all your clothes when unsure about their short-term reusability.</p>

  <p>The previous image uses the <a href=“https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/”>WebP format</a>—considerably smaller (27 KB) than PNG or JPEG. Despite its size, it retains most of its quality: no need to have multiple images for different viewports and resolutions.</p>
