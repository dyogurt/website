      <p>Recently I watched one of Jen Simmon's engaging CSS Grid tutorials about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EashgVqboWo" title="A video explaining how the CSS Grid lets us create overlaping in web design."><em>Overlap on the Web</em></a>. It made me wonder if I could use this approach to simulate duotone <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risograph" title="Information about the risograph printing process, techniques, and use cases.">risograph printing.</a></p>
      <h2>Risograph printing</h2>
      <p>Riso is a low-cost, low-energy, and sustainable printing method that combines screen printing and photocopying essences, printing one colour at a time and building layers to create a finished artwork. Different colours and intensities can be overlapped to obtain a wide range of possibilities.</p>

      <p>To test this web-riso approach, I'm using an illustration of the planet Saturn ♄ and the <a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/cassini/overview/" title="NASA website page with an overview of the Cassini-Huygens mission"><em>Cassini–Huygens</em></a> research mission's spacecraft. The original artwork has two colour channels: each corresponding to a different colour.</p>
