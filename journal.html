				<p>The weather is warm and sunny today, although it was a bit chilly this morning. I went for a walk in a nearby woods and botanical garden, which seems to be getting less and less maintained.</p>
				<p>Every once in a while, my dormant interest in web development flares up. Today is one of those days. I decided to restart an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web">MDN beginners course</a> and, while blowing the dust off my GitHub account, rediscovered the repository for this website.</p>
				<p>I'm going to start slow—HTML only—so I don't overdo it. Work on the basics until they become a habit.</p>
				<h3>HTML element of the day: Time</h3>
				<p>The <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/text-level-semantics.html#the-time-element">time</a> element lets me add the time of each journal entry in a machine-readable format.</p>
