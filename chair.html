      <p>I am using this space to sporadically explore HTML, CSS, and digital accessibility. It will probably work like a chair where you put all your clothes when unsure about their short-term reusability.</p>

      <h2>Images</h2>
      <p>The previous image uses the <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/">WebP format</a>—considerably smaller (27 KB) than PNG or JPEG. Despite its size, it retains most of its quality: no need to have multiple images for different viewports and resolutions.</p>
      <p>These days I am immersing myself in videos, articles, and posts about typography and layout: what to do or not to do and why. There are so many contradictory perspectives… I would like to slowly distill resilient guidelines for the growth of this site.</p>
