				<h2>Patio plants</h2>
				<time datetime="2025-05-05">5 May 2025</time>

			<p>Today it rains a lot after a long stretch of warm days. Too warm, too soon. I tuck my rosemary and marjoram plants under the air conditioning unit of my ground floor neighbours and hope they don’t mind. The herbs were planted two days ago from cuttings that had been, to my surprise, growing roots on glasses of water when the goal was to just keep them fresh.</p>
			<p>My RSS feed reader is becoming more pleasant to open and scroll through. A search on how to add this webpage to the feed tells me it’s not as simple as I hoped. GitHub Actions might help to automate the HTML to XML step.</p>
			<p>On a walk through the gently neglected <a href="https://ortobotanicotrieste.it/english/">botanical garden</a> with Pietro, we hear frog vocalisations, and see a little head poking out of a pond. I press play on my phone’s recorder.</p>
			<p>Days later, while listening to the wonderful <a href="https://www.thresholdpodcast.org/">Threshold Podcast</a>, they ask their listeners to share amphibian calls. “Perfect timing!” I think.</p>

			<p>Trying to identify the maker of the call proves difficult. Adding to the ID pressure, Sam, a producer at Threshold asks me if I know which species we are hearing.</p>

				<h2>Tiny bad and good practices</h2>
				<time datetime="2025-01-12">12 Jan 2025</time>
			</header>
			<p>Yesterday I discover the wonderful <a href="https://htmhell.dev/">HTMHell</a> website: “A collection of bad practices in HTML, copied from real websites.” It is a very nice collection of dos and don’ts for writing HTML. There was an article on the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/title/">the <code>title</code> element</a> that made me dive deep into this misleadingly simple action.

				<h2>“Content is what matters”</h2>
				<time datetime="2024-11-17">17 Nov 2024</time>
			</header>
			<p>It’s the <a href="https://smallseasons.guide/">Beginning of Winter</a>, and it’s getting chilly, even in the sunlight. I don’t know what I want this site to be or what it will look like; it has been blocking me from doing anything with it. So I’ll try a small post today, maybe an image next week.</p>
			<p>I learned about the <code>hgroup</code> HTML element and implemented it on this page and the homepage. It groups a single <code>h1–h6</code> element with one or more <code>p</code>. In other words, it defines a heading and its related content: a neat way of styling subtitles, if I get to that point.
			</p>
			<p>Next week I want to add at least one project with an illustration so I can practice optimising images for an <a href="https://laurelschwulst.com/e/talk-university-of-tennessee/">ultralight</a> website.</p>

				<h2>Back to learning web development</h2>
				<time datetime="2023-07-29">29 July 2023</time>
			</header>
			<p>The weather is warm and sunny today, although it was a bit chilly this morning. I went for a walk in a nearby woods and botanical garden, which seems to be getting less and less maintained.</p>
			<p>Every once in a while, my dormant interest in web development flares up. Today is one of those days. I decided to restart an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web">MDN beginners course</a> and, while blowing the dust off my GitHub account, rediscovered the repository for this website.</p>
			<p>I'm going to start slow—HTML only—so I don't overdo it. Work on the basics until they become a habit.</p>
			<h3>HTML element of the day: Time</h3>
			<p>The <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/text-level-semantics.html#the-time-element">time</a> element lets me add the time of each journal entry in a machine-readable format.</p>
