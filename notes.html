				<h2>Tiny bad and good practices</h2>
				<time datetime="2025-01-12">12 Jan 2025</time>
			</header>
			<p>Yesterday I discover the wonderfull <a href="https://htmhell.dev/">HTMHell</a> website: “A collection of bad practices in HTML, copied from real websites.” It is a very nice collection of dos and dont’s for writting HTML. There was an article on the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/title/">the <code>title</code> element</a> that made me dive deep into this misleadingly simple action.

				<h2>“Content is what matters”</h2>

			<p>It’s the <a href="https://smallseasons.guide/">Beginning of Winter</a>, and it’s getting chilly, even in the sunlight. I don’t know what I want this site to be or what it will look like; it has been blocking me from doing anything with it. So I’ll try a small post today, maybe an image next week.</p>
			<p>I learned about the <code>hgroup</code> HTML element and implemented it on this page and the homepage. It groups a single <code>h1–h6</code> element with one or more <code>p</code>. In other words, it defines a heading and its related content: a neat way of styling subtitles, if I get to that point.
			</p>
			<p>Next week I want to add at least one project with an illustration so I can practice optimizing images for an <a href="https://laurelschwulst.com/e/talk-university-of-tennessee/">ultralight</a> website.</p>

				<h2>Back to learning web development</h2>
				<time datetime="2023-07-29">29 July 2023</time>

			<p>The weather is warm and sunny today, although it was a bit chilly this morning. I went for a walk in a nearby woods and botanical garden, which seems to be getting less and less maintained.</p>
			<p>Every once in a while, my dormant interest in web development flares up. Today is one of those days. I decided to restart an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web">MDN beginners course</a> and, while blowing the dust off my GitHub account, rediscovered the repository for this website.</p>
			<p>I'm going to start slow—HTML only—so I don't overdo it. Work on the basics until they become a habit.</p>
			<h3>HTML element of the day: Time</h3>
			<p>The <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/text-level-semantics.html#the-time-element">time</a> element lets me add the time of each journal entry in a machine-readable format.</p>
